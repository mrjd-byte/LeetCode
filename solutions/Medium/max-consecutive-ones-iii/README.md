## Problem Description

_Source: LeetCode_

Given a binary array `nums` and an integer `k`, return *the maximum number of consecutive *`1`*'s in the array if you can flip at most* `k` `0`'s.

**Example 1:**

```text
**Input:** nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** [1,1,1,0,0,**1**,1,1,1,1,**1**]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
**Input:** nums = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], k = 3
**Output:** 10
**Explanation:** [0,0,1,1,**1**,**1**,1,1,1,**1**,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.

```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 105`

- `nums[i]` is either 0 or 1.

- `0 <= k <= nums.length`
