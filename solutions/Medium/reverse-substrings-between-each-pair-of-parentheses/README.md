## Problem Description

_Source: LeetCode_

You are given a string `s` that consists of lower case English letters and brackets.

Reverse the strings in each pair of matching parentheses, starting from the innermost one.

Your result should **not** contain any brackets.

**Example 1:**

```text
**Input:** s = "(abcd)"
**Output:** "dcba"

```

**Example 2:**

```text
**Input:** s = "(u(love)i)"
**Output:** "iloveu"
**Explanation:** The substring "love" is reversed first, then the whole string is reversed.

```

**Example 3:**

```text
**Input:** s = "(ed(et(oc))el)"
**Output:** "leetcode"
**Explanation:** First, we reverse the substring "oc", then "etco", and finally, the whole string.

```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 2000`

- `s` only contains lower case English characters and parentheses.

- It is guaranteed that all parentheses are balanced.
