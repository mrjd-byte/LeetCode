## Problem Description

_Source: LeetCode_

Given a circular integer array `nums` (i.e., the next element of `nums[nums.length - 1]` is `nums[0]`), return *the **next greater number** for every element in* `nums`.

The **next greater number** of a number `x` is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, return `-1` for this number.

**Example 1:**

```text
**Input:** nums = [1,2,1]
**Output:** [2,-1,2]
Explanation: The first 1's next greater number is 2;
The number 2 can't find next greater number.
The second 1's next greater number needs to search circularly, which is also 2.

```

**Example 2:**

```text
**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,4,3]
**Output:** [2,3,4,-1,4]

```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 104`

- `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
